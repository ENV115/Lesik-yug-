          <p class="byline">  ”Lesik-Yug” is leading consulting company in Central Asia for the development of rural areas with a focus on the walnut sector.
            
            The PO ”Lesik-Yug” supports the project implementation with technical consultancy for the
            local population and leskhozes and the development of their capacity. More than 65 hectares
            in the territory of six leskhozes have been fenced and walnut trees have been planted. Sixty
            nine agreements between leshozes and forest users have been concluded for the re- and
            afforestation of state forest fund land. The tenants are supported in using innovative methods
            of water supply, improvement of seeds and planting material, and are equipped with tools
            and mechanisms (a cultivator and the necessary materials for nurseries). Forest specialists
            selected mother trees that are growing very well for which they then use the seeds for future
            plantation. These trees are called “plus” trees and receive some sort of a passport to
            document their data. In the area 10-15 in each leskhoze (around 70 in total) potential plus
            trees have been identified. At the breast height of the tree a white strip is painted and they
            are marked with a number which is registered in a special journal. The undergrowth of the
            tree is then cut. In the future, seeds are collected from the tree, and planted separately from
            others. These high quality seeds will be used for afforestation. </p>
